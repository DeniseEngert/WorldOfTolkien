    <h1>Hobbits</h1>
    <h2>General</h2>
    <div>ancient, unintrusive people<br>
        relatives of Men more than of Elves and Dwarves<br>
        spoke the language of Men (of their own fashion) and liked and disliked much the same things Men did<br>
        beginnings lie far back in the elder days, now lost and forgotten<br></div>
    <h2>Appearances</h2>
    <div>Hobbits are small people, about half the height of humans, even smaller than dwarves (between two and four
        feet).<br>
        They have no beards, but thick, brown, curly hair. They are inclined to be a bit fat around the stomach.<br>
        Their faces are good-natured and they laugh a deep, fruity laugh, especially after dinner (which they have twice
        a day, when they can get it). Broad, bright eyes, red-cheeked, with mouths apt to laughter, and eating, and
        drinking.<br>
        The colours of their clothes are bright, chiefly green and yellow. They wear no shoes, though, because their
        feet developed leathery soles and thick, warm, brown hair.<br>
    </div>
    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <div>
        They hear well, have the ability to move very silently and they possess the art of disappearing swiftly.<br>
        Hobbits are quick of hearing and sharp-eyed.<br>
        They have long and very skillful fingers, additionally to being very good with tools.<br>
        Hobbits know little to no magic.
    </div>
    <h2>Nature</h2>
    <div>
        loved to eat and drink and laugh - often and heartily (six meals a day)<br>
        hospitable and delighted in parties and presents, which they gave away freely and eagerly accepted<br>
        do not hurry unnecessary, but are nimble and deft in movements<br>
        love peace and quiet and a well-tilled earth<br>
    </div>
    <h2>Tribes, Families, Breeds</h2>
    <h3>Breeds</h3>
    <div>
        <i>Harfoots</i>:
        <ul>
            <li>browner in skin, smaller and shorter, beardless and bootless,</li>
            <li>preferred highlands and hillsides</li>
            <li>had much to do with dwarves in ancient times</li>
            <li>lived long in the foothills of the mountains, moved westward early,</li>
            <li>most inclined to settle in one place, preserved their ancestral habit of living in tunnels and holes the
                longest
            </li>
        </ul>
        <i>Stoors</i>:
        <ul>
            <li>broader and heavier in build, hands and feeds where larger,</li>
            <li>preferred flatlands and riversides,</li>
            <li>came west after the Harfoots</li>
        </ul>
        <i>Fallohides</i>:
        <ul>
            <li>fairer in skin and hair, taller and slimmer than the others,</li>
            <li>lovers of trees and woodlands,</li>
            <li>least in numbers,</li>
            <li>northerly branch,</li>
            <li>more skill in language and song than in handicrafts</li>
        </ul>
