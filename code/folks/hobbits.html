    <h2>Appearances</h2>
    <div>Hobbits are small people, about half the height of humans, even smaller than dwarves (between two and four
        feet). They have no beards, but
        <br>
        thick, brown, curly hair. They are inclined to be a bit fat around the stomach.<br>
        The colours of their clothes are bright, chiefly green and yellow. They wear no shoes, though, because their
        feet<br>
        developed leathery soles and thick, warm, brown hair.<br>

    </div>
    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <div>
        They hear well, and have the ability to move very silently.<br>
        Hobbits know little to no magic.
        They have long, clever (skillful) fingers.
    </div>
    <h2>Nature</h2>
    <div>
        Their faces are good natured and they laugh a deep, fruity laugh, especially after dinner (which they have<br>
        twice a day, when they can get it).<br>
        broad, bright eyes, red-cheeked, with mouths apt to laughter, and eating, and drinking<br>
        loved to eat and drink and laugh - often and heartily (six meals a day)<br>
        hospitable and delighted in parties and presents, which they gave away freely and eagerly accepted

    <div>ancient, unintrusive people<br>
        love peace and quiet and a well-tilled earth<br>
        good with tools<br>
        quick of hearing and sharp-eyed<br>
        do not hurry unnecessary, but are nimble and deft in movements<br>
        possess the art if disappearing swiftly and silently<br>
        relatives of Men more than of Elves and Dwarves<br>
        spoke the language of Men (of their own fashion) and liked and disliked much the same things Men did<br>
        beginnings lie far back in the elder days, now lost and forgotten<br>
        3 breeds: Harfoots, Stoors and Fallohides<br>
        Harfoots: browner in skin, smaller and shorter, beardless and bootless, preferred highlands and hillsides, had
        much to do with dwarves in ancient times, lived long in the foothills of the mountains, moved westward early, most
        inclined to settle in one place, preserved their ancestral habit of living in tunnels and holes the longest<br>
        Stoors: broader and heavier in build, hands and feeds where larger, preferred flatlands and riversides, came west after the Harfoots<br>
        Fallohides: fairer in skin and hair, taller and slimmer than the others, lovers of trees and woodlands, least in numbers, northerly branch, more skill in language ans song than in handicrafts
