                    <p>This story begins 60 years after Bilbo started his first journey. It is now S. R. 1401, and Bilbo
                        is about to celebrate his hundred-and-eleventh birthday, together with Frodo, who turns 33.<br>
                        So, there is a party again, though not an unexpected one, where Bilbo performs a disappearing
                        act.
                        Frodo becomes the heir of Bag End and has to fend off relatives and friends, so they do not rob
                        him dry. After all of Bilbo's wishes are carried out, peace returns to Bag End, but not before
                        Gandalf swears Frodo to absolute secrecy about The Ring.</p>

                    <p>Time goes by in the shire, things settle down and Bilbo becomes the subject of tales and rumours,
                        and Frodo gains a reputation not unlike the one Bilbo acquired.<br> 17 years after the big
                        farewell party - it is April now - Gandalf reappears in Bag End.
                        He tells Frodo everything he has learned about The Ring in Frodo's possession, about how he came
                        to be there, about its former owners, about its origins and about its powers. Frodo is
                        overwhelmed. But decisions need to be made. And a decision is being made: to leave the Shire and
                        take The Ring with him. But he is not to go alone: Sam Gamgee has been conscripted to go with
                        him.

                        until a plan was formed. At the end of June Gandalf is leaving.<br>
                        On September the 20th Frodo's belongings are moved to his new home. But when Gandalf still isn't
                        back on the 22nd, a Thursday, worries arise.<br>
                        Frodo, Sam and Pippin are on their way by foot, their journey will take them three days. On
                        their way they encounter the enemy - Black Riders - for the first time and get protection and

                        country, avoiding the street and hoping to find a good shortcut. But they are followed by the
                        Black Rider.
                        They find shelter (and good food) with Farmer Maggot, who tells them about being questioned by a
                        Black Rider. The good man offers to give them a ride to the Bucklebury ferry, where they are met
                        by Merry.</p>

                        And it is here where Frodo reveals his plan to leave the Shire, a plan he thought was a well
                        kept a secret. Not only is he mistaken here, he learns, but also do his friends reveal their own
                        secrets. And plans. And suddenly, a traveling party of two grew to four.<br>
                        After this is setted, preparations are made to leave Crickhollow the next morning.</p>

                        leave the Shire and ride into the Old Forest. Fatty Bolger stays behind and works to obfuscate
                        the departure of Frodo.<br>
                        After a rather uneventful journey through the wood they encounter a rather unusual attack:

                        sing if in distress. So he sings, and Tom comes to save the day.<br>
                        To secure their save journey through his land, Tom accompanies them until the reach the border

                        ally. But bad news loom over them. Gandalf's whereabouts are unknown, the Black Riders are in

                        in the same night in Bree, and here Strider is watchful. The attack and its aftermath delay
                        their departure for at least three hours, they can not slip away quietly anymore, and they lose
                        money to the traitor Lutz Farning. But depart they do, and Strider leads them through the
                        wilderness safely and mostly unobserved.<br>
                        On the 5th of October, six days after they left Bree, they reached the mountains close to
                        Weathertop, and the next day they reach Weathertop itself. The find signs that someone was here
                        about three ays ago, but have a hard time to interpret them. </p>
                    And it is here that the black riders make their next move and attack. Frodo is hit by a weapon made
                    in Mordor.

                        unharmed and meet Glorfindel on their way to the Loudwater. From him they learn there is still
                        no news about Gandalf. They continue towards the Ford of Bruinen, where they finally encounter
                        the nine black riders again. Frodo flees over the river, makes it barely across but witnesses

                    <h3 class="title">The Bridge Of Khazad-Dûm</h3>
                    <p>In Balin's Tomb they learn about the faith of his company. Five years they were able to hold
                        Moria, but then were overcome by the enemy. Non of Balin's company survived.<br>
                        And the fellowship is in danger to suffer the same faith, since they are attacked by Orcs and
                        Uruks ... and something unknown to them, even Gandalf. They flee towards the Bridge of
                        Khazad-Dûm.<br>
                        They reach the bridge, but so does the enemy. And now they know what the Unknown is: a Balrog,
                        also known as Durins Bane. Nobody but Gandalf take on the challenge. The fight is
                        strength-sapping, but Gandalf holds the upper hand. But with a last lunge the Balrog lashes out
                        and takes Gandalf with him into the abyss.<br>
                        With the last of their strength the rest of the company reaches the gates and escapes Moria.</p>

                    <p>Having escaped Moria and its new inhabitants, the company flees toward the woods of Lothlórien.
                        They meet the Galadhrim there and are offered protection for the night. But not only the company
                        reached Lothlórien. So did a company of orks and Gollum. The former will never leave Lorien
                        again.</p>
