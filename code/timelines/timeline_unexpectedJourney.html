                    <p>In his 50th year - S. R. 1341 - Bilbo is chosen by Gandalf to accompany Thorin's fellowship on
                        its quest to take
                        back Erebor.<br>
                        The unexpected journey is preceded by an unexpected house party, where Bilbo learns about the
                        rough but good-natured personalities that will be his company in the coming months - and
                        adventures.<br>
                        He also learns about the terms and conditions of the quest, but doesn't seem to grasp the
                        gravity of it, yet.</p>

                    <p>At the end of April, after a short-lived belief the danger of going on an adventure has passed
                        by, Bilbo and the dwarves start their journey in Bywater.<br>
                        During a particularly unpleasant patch of the journey in May, Bilbo got his first job as a
                        burglar and went up against trolls, got the dwarves in trouble and Gandalf saved their asses.

                    <p>In June, our fellowship reaches Rivendell, where they stayed for at least a fortnight. Nothing
                        remarkable is to say about that stay. They got good sleep and good food.<br>
                        The day after midsummer eve they traveled on, but not before Elrond discovered moon runes on
                        Thorin's map that told them when and how they can find the secret entry to Erebor.</p>

                        constant climbing Bilbo and the Dwarves witnessed a battle of the Rock Giants, fled from it - on
                        a Monday night or a Tuesday morning - right into the arms of Goblins.</p>

                    <p>Bilbo got out of the Goblin Caves and found his friends in the woods. By now it's Thursday, and
                        the fellowship has gone astray too far to the north and an awkward country lays ahead.<br>
                        They witness an assembly of wargs and become aware of a planned undertaking to kill the people
                        of the woods. A battle of fire between the companionship, the wargs and goblins flares up<br>
                        and only air support is able to help them out of this pickle.</p>

                        equally remarkable host.<br>
                        Stories are exchanged, help, warnings and good advice is granted. They leave Beorn's house and
                        ride north along the Great River for four days until they reach the edge of Mirkwood.<br>
                        This is also where Gandalf leaves the tour party and goes on wizard business.</p>

                    <p>The dwarfs and the hobbit enter the dark forrest and experience a dreadful journey through
                        darkness. After many days they reach the enchanted river, manage to cross it and by accident
                        Bombur becomes
                        a very inactive member of the troop.
                        Four days after the crossed the water, they sense first signs that they are getting close to a
                        civilisation again. Two days later at least Bilbo sees the sun again by being sent up into the
                        trees to check
                        how far they still have to go until they reached the other side of the forrest.
                        Hungry and thirsty they witness a gathering of Elves, and in the hopes of food and drink, they
                        leave the path ... and lose their way. They are attacked by giant Spiders, are saved by Bilbo
                        and his very useful
                        find. And they discover too late that Thorin is missing.</p>

                    <p>One day later the remaining dwarves and Bilbo chose a direction and try to find the way out of
                        the wood. But they are apprehended by the elves and imprisoned in the Elvenking's underground
                        castle. Only Bilbo escapes with the help of the ring,
                        but gets into the castle anyway, where he searches for a way to help the dwarves for about two
                        weeks. The solution were barrels, in which they floated out of the Wood Elves kingdom towards
                        Lake Town.</p>

                        The dwarves are welcomed in Lake Town and stay for about two weeks. They recover from there
                        ordeal in the prison cells of the King of the Wood Elves and their wet escape. Provided with
                        weapons, provisions, ponies and horses, they set out on the last leg of their journey. </p>

                        They find, after some exploring, the secret door into Erebor, but it takes them until the last

                        of taking back Erebor has a glaring hole: how to deal with the dragon.<br>
                        Smaug is enraged given Bilbo's theft and the presence of dwarves, and after failing to find
                        them,

                        Only three days after Smaug's demise the army of the Elvenking is already on its way towards
