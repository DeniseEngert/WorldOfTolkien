          <h3 class="title">An Unexpected Journey</h3>
          <p>In his 50th year Bilbo is chosen by Gandalf to accompany Thorins fellowship on its quest to take back Erebor.<br>
          The unexpected journey is preceded by an unexpected house party, where Bilbo learns about the rough but good-natured personalities that will be his company in the coming months - and adventures.<br>
          He also learns about the terms and conditions of the quest, but doesn't seem to grasp the gravity of it, yet.</p>

          <p>At the end of April, after a short-lived belief the danger of going on an adventure has passed by, Bilbo and the dwarves start their journey in Bywater.<br>
          During a particularly unpleasant patch of the journey in May, Bilbo got his first job as a burglar and went up against trolls, got the dwarves in trouble and Gandalf saved their asses.</p>

          <h3 class="title">A Short Rest</h3>
          <p>In June, our fellowship reaches Rivendell, where they stayed for at least a fortnight. Nothing remarkable is to say about that stay. They got good sleep and good food.<br>
            The day after midsummer eve they traveled on, but not before Elrond discovered moon runes on Thorin's map that told them when and how they can find the secret entry to Erebor.</p>

          <h3 class="title">Over The Hill And Under The Hill</h3>
          <p>The journey let from Rivendell directly into the Misty Mountains, where after a few days of constant climbing Bilbo and the Dwarves witnessed a battle of the Rock Giants, fled from it - on a Monday night or a Tuesday morning - right into the arms of Goblins.</p>

          <p>Fleeing from the goblins, Bilbo is separated from his companions and finds himself alone in a cave, where he meets an important turning point of his life. And Gollum.<br>
          A game of riddles leads to another flight and the discovery of something ... very helpful.</p>

          <p>Bilbo got out of the Goblin Caves and found his friends in the woods. By now it's Thursday, and the fellowship has gone astray too far to the north and an awkward country lays ahead.<br>
          They witness an assembly of wargs and become aware of a planned undertaking to kill the people of the woods. A battle of fire between the companionship, the wargs and goblins flares up<br>
          and only air support is able to help them out of this pickle.</p>

          <h3 class="title">Queer Loggings</h3>
          <p>Gandalf, Bilbo and the dwarfs find shelter for two nights in a house most remarkable, with an equally remarkable host.<br>
          Stories are exchanged, help, warnings and good advice is granted. They leave Beorn's house and ride north along the Great River for four days until they reach the edge of Mirkwood.<br>
          This is also where Gandalf leaves the tour party and goes on wizard business.</p>

          <h3 class="title">Flies And Spiders</h3>
          <p>The dwarfs and the hobbit enter the dark forrest and experience a dreadfull journey through darkness. After many days they reach the enchanted river, manage to cross it and by accident Bombur becomes
            a very inactive member of the troop.
          Four days after the crossed the water, they sense first signs that they are getting close to a civilisation again. Two days later at least Bilbo sees the sun again by being sent up into the trees to check
          how far they still have to go until they reached the other side of the forrest.
          Hungry and thirsty they witness a gathering of Elves, and in the hopes of food and drink, they leave the path ... and lose their way. They are attacked by giant Spiders, are saved by Bilbo and his very usefull
          find. And they discover too late that Thorin is missing.</p>

          <h3 class="title">Barrels Out Of Bond</h3>
          <p>One day later the remaining dwarves and Bilbo chose a direction and try to find the way out of the wood. But they are apprehended by the elves and imprisoned in the Elvenkings underground castle. Only Bilbo escapes with the help of the ring,
          but gets into the castle anyway, where he searches for a way to help the dwarves for about two weeks. The solution were barrels, in which they floated out of the Wood Elves kingdom towards Lake Town.</p>

          <p>There he is: The Lonely Mountain. Bilbo sees it for the very first time ... and doesn't like the look of it.<br>
          The dwarves are welcomed in Lake Town and stay for about two weeks. They recover from there ordeal in the prison cells of the King of the Wood Elves and their wet escape. Provided with weapons, provisions, ponies and horses, they set out on the last leg of their journey. </p>
