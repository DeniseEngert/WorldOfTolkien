    <h1>The World Of J. R. R. Tolkien</h1>

<h2>Disclaimer:</h2>
<p>This is a hobby project. Probably done by thousands before me. And a lot of people will probably do it again after
    me.</p>
<p>While I read through the books of Tolkiens World of Middle Earth, I will create genealogies, timelines,
    histories.</p>
<p>I created none of the characters, worlds, storylines described here. All if this is the work of J. R. R. Tolkien.</p>
<p>I solely cataloguize.</p>
<p>For everything listed/ described here, I will always put the source (Book, Edition, Page)</p>
<p>All the sources can also be found listed on the page "Sources".</p>
